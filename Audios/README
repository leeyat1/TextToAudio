# TextsToOneAudio

TextsToOneAudio is a Python script that converts text from PDF files into a single MP3 audio file. This script uses the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to generate audio for each page of the PDF and then combines them into a final audio file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install gtts PyPDF2 pydub
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TextsToOneAudio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd TextsToOneAudio
   ```

3. Modify the `pdf_directory` and `audio_directory` variables in `main.py` to point to your PDF files and desired audio output directory.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. The final audio file (`final_audio.mp3`) will be created in the specified `audio_directory`, and individual audio segments will be deleted.
